Save the p1 package AND the lib folder into a new Eclipse project such that they are in the same folder in your file system. 

IMPORTANT:
Now, in Eclipse, right click the lib folder and select Build Path > Configure Build Path. In this window, select the tab Libraries, and on the right, select add JARs. Click the project folder and find mysql-connector-java-5.1.44-bin.jar and select it. You should be good.

Now run the program through MainPage.java and if you get no errors, exit out of the application and you should see some names printed in the console. This means the connection to Carson's DB is good.
